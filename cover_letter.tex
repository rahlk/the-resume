I am writing to apply for a full-time position at Bloomberg. I am a Final year 
Ph. D. student majoring in computer science from North Carolina State 
University. I am being advised by Dr. Tim Menzies. My research focuses 
primarily on empirical software engineering, computational linguistics, and 
data driven decision making.

I believe that I have the industrial and research experience required to be an 
effective team member at your group. In terms of industrial experience, I have 
worked extensively with machine learning, natural language processing, and 
their applications to legal text mining. Following is a brief summary of my 
work:\\[0.33cm]
\begin{itemize}
	\item Over the summer of 2017, I worked on 
deploying large scale computational linguistics and 
machine learning algorithms for processing over 1 million of legal documents. 
Specifically, I developed tools for automated text summarization of very large 
legal documents using TensorFlow. With these I was able to summarize large 
legal documents into so-called \textit{headnotes}. Subject matter experts 
opined that 
these headnotes were very similar to human-generated analogs. Further, I was 
also responsible for developing additional machine learning algorithms so that 
they can be deployed to production. To achieve this, I worked extensively with 
the devops pipeline within the AWS ecosystem to enable seamless integration of 
machine learning algorithms with the current product.\\[0.1cm]
 \item In the summer of 2016, I was tasked with "opening the black-box" that is 
 SVM. For this, I designed a sandbox app for e-discovery. This sandbox was very 
 useful improving the classification accuracy of SVM by approximately 20\%. My 
 Contributions include: 
 (1) Translating internal mechanisms of SVM into human comprehensible format. 
 For this, I extracted the support vectors and mapped them to actual words, 
 phrases, and paragraphs in the text. These were then presented to users so 
 they may get some insights on how SVM made its prediction; 
 (2) By soliciting feedback from the end users (human-in-loop) regarding the 
 quality of these support vectors, I was able to incorporate these feedback 
 with the help of active learning to improve the text classification accuracy 
 of SVM.
 
\end{itemize}

As to my research work, several of my recent papers show that I have done work 
in areas that may be of further interest to you. Much of my work studies how 
machine learning applications can be applied to streamline software engineering 
practices. I have 3 papers 
under review at this time for the ICSE'18 software engineering in practice 
track.  \\[0.33cm]

As to my accepted work, I have published an article at \textit{Automated 
Software 
Engineering} 2016, Singapore. I also have two accepted papers premier journals 
such as \textit{IEEE Transactions in Software Engineering} and 
and \textit{Information and Software Technology} journal. My other work at 
\textit{IEEE Transactions in Software Engineering} 
journal is awaiting a second round 
review. These are listed below:\\[0.33cm]

I strongly believe that I would be an asset to your organization. A full-time 
position here would provide me with the ideal opportunity to assist your 
organization and to further expand my skills.

I have attached my resume for your reference. If you feel that my 
qualifications seem to be a match for positions in your organization, I should 
greatly appreciate an opportunity to schedule an interview at a mutually 
convenient time.

Thank you very much for your consideration.
